# odin-recipes

This project is to build a basic recipe website using the HTML knowledge I have acquired to-date.

On completion of the project, I will have demonstrated how to:

- Set up a GitHub repository
- Get files to and from GitHub
- Use the Git workflow; including stage, commit, push
- Create directory with relevant .html files
- Create content using headings, paragraphs, images, and unordered and ordered lists
- Link to new pages from the index page
