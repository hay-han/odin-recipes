        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>50g organic porridge oats</li>
                <li>150ml soy milk alternative</li>
                <li>1 medjool date</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground flaxseed</li>
                <li>1 tbsp peanut butter</li>
                <li>10 raspberries</li>
                <li>10 blueberries</li>
                <li>10g nuts/coconut shavings/seeds to serve</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop the medjool date into small chunks, and add this together with the organic oats, soy milk alternative, and flaxseed to a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Give the contents a good stir and bring to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Add the peanut butter and raspberries to the pan. Stir well to incorporate the peanut butter and to break down the raspberries slightly.</li>
                <li>Lower the heat, and stir continuously until the oats are cooked through and the consistency is to your liking. Add more milk alternative if it becomes too thick or starts to catch on the pan.</li>
                <li>Serve the porridge topped with the nuts/seeds and blueberries.</li>
            </ol>
